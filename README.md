# SnakeGame

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Java and Swing.

# Instructions

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake.
<br>The goal is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the game boundaries.
<br>Each time the snake eats an apple, its length increases and the player's score is incremented.
<br>The game ends when the snake collides with its own body or the game boundaries.
